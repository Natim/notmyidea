    <h1>Pelican, 9 months later</h1>
    <p class="date">Published on Mon 25 July 2011</p>
    <p>Back in October, I released <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.notmyidea.org/alexis/pelican">pelican</a>,
a little piece of code I wrote to power this weblog. I had simple needs: I wanted
to be able to use my text editor of choice (vim), a vcs (mercurial) and
restructured text. I started to write a really simple blog engine
in something like a hundred python lines and released it on github.</p>
<p>And people started contributing. I wasn't at all expecting to see people
interested in such a little piece of code, but it turned out that they were.
I refactored the code to make it evolve a bit more by two times and eventually,
in 9 months, got 49 forks, 139 issues and 73 pull requests.</p>
<p><strong>Which is clearly awesome.</strong></p>
<p>I pulled features such as translations, tag
clouds, integration with different services such as twitter or piwik, import
from dotclear and rss, fixed
a number of mistakes and improved a lot the codebase. This was a proof that
there is a bunch of people that are willing to make better softwares just for
the sake of fun.</p>
<p>Thank you, guys, you're why I like open source so much.</p>
