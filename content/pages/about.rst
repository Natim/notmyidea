Hey !
#####

Hi, I'm Alexis MÃ©taireau, a python developer since late 2009, I'm currently
working at `Mozilla <http://mozilla.org>`_ on the *Services* team, when I try
to scale up our services.

this is my web log. I like to put here some thoughts, both in french and
english.

On my spare time, I contribute to open source projets, and hack a bit python,
django and php.

You can find most of the computer related projects I am involved with 
`on my github page <http://github.com/ametaireau>`_. or on `the Mozilla services
github page <https://github.com/mozilla-services>`_

I'm also interested by meeting real people and doing *real* things, out of 
the scope of computer science. My interest are related to education,
agriculture and free society.
