Hey !
#####

Hi, I'm Alexis and this is my web log. I like to put here some thoughts, both
in french and english.

On my spare time, I contribute to open source projets, and hack a bit python,
django and php.

You can find all the computer related projects I am involved with 
`on my github page <http://github.com/ametaireau>`_. 

I'm also interested by meeting real people and doing real things, out of 
the scope of computer science. My interest goes mainly to alternative 
trading mechanisms, agriculture and alternative in general.

Python
======

Since I've discovered python in the late 2009, I really like the simplicity it
brings to the development. Here are some of the projects I've done using it:

* `pelican <http://alexis.notmyidea.org/pelican>`_, A simple static blog
  generator, which is used to see this page.
* `gnome-background-generator
  <http://github.com/ametaireau/gnome-background-generator>`_ A set of tools to
  dynamically switch your background wallpaper on GNOME.
* I've done a Google Summer of Code on `distutils2 <http://distutils2.notmyidea.org>`_,
  the packaging tool for python, and try to use some of my spare time to contribute.
  Packaging is a really useful thing, and distutils2 tries to make it simpler
  and to build a framework every python packaging tool can use.

Django
======

Django is a web framework written in python. I've been working on it while in
internship at `makina corpus <http://makina-corpus.com>`_. And also tries to
use them for my web related projects.

* `bison vert <http://www.bisonvert.net>`_, a carpooling system.
* `dropit <http://dropit.notmyidea.org>`_, a note management project, using the
  power if CouchDB.
* `django-oauth-client <http://bitbucket.org/bisonvert/django-oauthclient>`_ ,
  a django application to simplify the tree-legged-authentication process.

PHP
===

I've started programming with PHP, it was my third first language 
(the first two ones being pascal and visual basic). 

I've written a `dependency injection container
<http://bitbucket.org/ametaireau/spiral-di>`_ and 
`spiral <http://www.spiral-project.org>`_, a web framework in PHP 5.3, with
a friend.

I've also contributed (a bit) to `jelix <http://www.jelix.org>`_, another PHP 
framework.
