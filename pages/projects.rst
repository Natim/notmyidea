Projects
########

On my spare time, I contribute to open source projets, and hack a bit python,
django and php.

Python
======

Since I've discovered python in the late 2009, I'm a big fan of it. I use it for
quite all my applications, when it's adapted.

* `pelican <http://alexis.notmyidea.org/pelican>`_, A simple static blog
  generator.
* `gnome-background-generator
  <http://github.com/ametaireau/gnome-background-generator>`_ A set of tools to
  set your desktop dynamically on gnome.
* I've done a Google Summer of Code on `distutils2 <http://distutils2.notmyidea.org>`_,
  the packaging tool for python, and try to use my spare time to contribute.

Django
======

* `bison vert <http://www.bisonvert.net>`_, a carpooling system.
* `dropit <http://dropit.notmyidea.org>`_, a note management project, using the
  power if CouchDB.
* `django-oauth-client <http://bitbucket.org/bisonvert/django-oauthclient>`_ ,
  a django application to simplify the tree-legged-authentication process.

PHP
===

PHP is the third language I've used, the first two ones being pascal and visual
basic. I've done a `dependency injection container
<http://bitbucket.org/ametaireau/spiral-di>`_ and 
`spiral <http://www.spiral-project.org>`_, a web framework in PHP 5.3. 

I've also contributed (a bit) to `jelix <http://www.jelix.org>`_, another PHP 
framework.
